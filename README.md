# Exploration of pH variations in lagers brewed with two strains from Labo Solution yeasts
---
## Dataset :
Beers brewed from 2 different locations, with 2 different types of lager yeast strains. Data consists of post-boil pH (pre-yeast), post-pitch pH (post-yeast addition) and final pH witouth any dry-hopping :
><b>Fact: </b> We use pre dry-hopping (DH) pH because cold addition of hops is known to increase the pH of the beer. It will be then irrelevant to compare beers that have a different cold-hopping regime :

## Data collection :
pH readings taken at 15-25 C with ThermoFisher Orion A111 or Hanna Edge pH meter. Gravity readings with either traditional hydrometer or EasyDens (Anton Paar)

## Data types : 
Categorical, numerical and transformed/computed.
